# The Boardgames Shelf

Developer: Stefania Frustagli

## App Overview

Welcome to my board game marketplace! This e-commerce platform is designed to connect board game enthusiasts looking to buy and sell used board games. Whether you’re clearing out your collection or searching for that rare gem, this site provides a user-friendly experience to meet your needs.

Sellers can list their board games, complete with details and images, and specify their location, making it easier for buyers to find games available nearby. My goal is to foster a community of gamers who can trade, sell, and discover new games with ease. 

#### Type of App: E-Commerce

The app functions as an e-commerce platform where users can list and sell their second-hand board games. Each transaction involves a single payment for the purchased game.

- **Business to Consumer (B2C)**: The app facilitates transactions directly between board game sellers (users) and buyers (customers).

- **Product Type**: Physical product - users sell their own board games.

- **Payment Model**: Single payment for each board game sold.

### Why The Boardgame Shelf?

The idea for this application stemmed from a clear gap in the market. There isn’t a dedicated, comprehensive website where board game enthusiasts can easily buy and sell used board games while managing their collections. Current platforms are fragmented and often lack the specific features needed by the board gaming community. By creating this e-commerce site, I aim to provide a centralised solution. 

My long term plan is to enable users to:
- Sell Used Board Games: list pre-owned games for sale;
- Discover Nearby Sellers: find games from sellers in a certain area;
- Catalogue Collections: in future updates, users will be able to create and manage databases of the games they own, want to sell, wish to buy, and have played;
- Review and Share: write reviews and share the gaming experiences with the community.

I would like to create a vibrant marketplace and community for board game lovers, making it easier to buy, sell, and manage board games in one place.

## Project background

### Problem Statement

I've noticed that among board gamers, 'fanatic' collecting is common, and buying games is almost a compulsive act. It's also common for them to get rid of games they don't play anymore. Instead of using eBay, I wanted to create a specific place for buying and selling second-hand games and to create a library of board games. There isn’t a dedicated, comprehensive website where board game enthusiasts can easily buy and sell used board games while managing their collections. Current platforms are fragmented and often lack the specific features needed by the board gaming community.

**Proposed solution**: 
With the creation of this platform, I aim to fill this gap and provide a centralized solution. 

### Business Organization
The business organization concerning sales is currently in its draft stages and not fully defined yet. One model could be to operate similarly to eBay, initially taking a percentage of each sale. In the future, I may explore implementing a subscription-based mechanism.

**Rationale**
This decision to adopt a commission-based model akin to eBay reflects a practical approach I would like to adopt, aimed at  generating revenue from transactions while providing value to my users. This model could allow me to ensure sustainability as I grow. As I evolve, I may explore additional monetization strategies, such as subscription services, to offer enhanced features and benefits to the community of board game enthusiasts.

#### Business goal

My goal is to create a portal where board game players can sell their second-hand games and - this will be a future feature - manage their collections within a comprehensive database. Creating an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing app is the primary objective.

#### Strategies
Some of the marketing strategies I plan to implement include:

- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Optimizing the website content to rank higher in search engine results for relevant keywords.

- **Content Marketing and Social Media Marketing**: Creating compelling online content on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. This includes engaging posts about games, captivating images of board games, coverage of conventions, and highlights of second-hand games available on the website.

- **Design**: Emphasizing a visually appealing and functional design to enhance user experience.

- **Social Media Marketing**: Focusing on organic growth strategies to build a community of board game enthusiasts.

- **Email Marketing**: Utilizing email campaigns to inform users about new second-hand games available for sale and other updates.

- **Collaborations and Affiliate Marketing**: Partnering with board game creators and exploring affiliate marketing opportunities to expand outreach and user engagement.

#### Initial Budget
In the beginning, I'll use low-cost marketing strategies. If things go well, I might invest more to grow the business into something bigger.

### SEO Implementations

#### SEO Keywords

To optimize the website for search engines, common keywords related to board games were researched and utilized. I brainstormed several words with the intent to ensure that board game enthusiasts can find the website. The common words were identified using Google search engine results.

The initial list of keywords included:

Board game geek,
Board game arena,
Board games bazaar,
Board games market,
Board game catalogue,
Sell your board games,
Used board games,
Buy board games,
Popular board games,
Board games geek,
Second-hand board games,
Sell your own game,
Best way to sell board games in UK,
Board game store near me,
BGG marketplace,
Virtual flea board games market,
Board game arena

Selection: Keywords were selected based on their relevance and potential to attract board game enthusiasts. Even if some keywords were not strictly relevant, they were kept to ensure maximum visibility.

**Final Keyword List**: 

- Boardgame marketplace
- Board game shelf
- Board game shop near me
- Board game geek
- Board games market
- Second-hand board games
- Sell board games
- Used board games
- Buy board games

I think that these keywords cover a broad range of relevant search terms to ensure the site is visible to users searching for board games online.


### Marketing Strategy 
Even though the website can be used by anyone who wants to sell board games, I have a specific market in mind: those who have large collections of board games, stay up-to-date with new releases and buy games compulsively. As a regular member at various board game clubs, I know that dedicated board game players and collectors currently lack a decent place to sell and buy second-hand games, apart from Facebook groups. Moreover, they don’t have a platform to share and update their collections. My goal here is to create a platform similar to Goodreads, but for board games, and attract all the board games enthusiasts.

To start, I will focus on organic social media marketing, creating Social Media Accounts:
- I will open Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok accounts to advertise the website;
- I will start following all the board game pages I know.

#### Users and relevant platforms

My ideal users would mainly be ‘nerds’ and geeky individuals, spanning various age groups, who may use different social media platforms. Based on my experience and observations, marketing the website on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok will effectively reach them.

**Age Group (45-60 years)**:
- Primarily use Facebook.
- Strategy: Engage with Facebook groups and pages dedicated to board games.

**Age Group (25-35 years)**:
- Prefer Instagram. Facebook can be used as well.
- Strategy: Use visually appealing content on Instagram and Facebook.

**Age Group (25-35 years)**:
- Prefer Instagram and TikTok.
- Strategy: Create engaging short-form videos on TikTok to attract this demographic.

By focusing my marketing efforts on these platforms and considering user behaviors, I aim to create a vibrant community of board game enthusiasts.

#### Possible ideas tailored to each platform:

1. **Instagram:**
   - Showcasing high-quality images of popular board games along with brief descriptions and prices;
   - Creating carousel posts featuring before-and-after images of well-loved board games being sold on the platform, highlighting the value of buying second-hand;
   - Sharing user-generated content by reposting photos of customers enjoying board games purchased from the website. Encouraging users to tag the account and use a specific hashtag to be featured;
   - Utilising Instagram Stories to announce new arrivals and share behind-the-scenes glimpses of the business;
   - Collaborating with board game influencers or creators to reach a wider audience and gain credibility within the community.

2. **Facebook:**
   - Sharing informative and engaging blog posts or articles related to board games, such as "Top 10 Board Games to Play This Summer" or "How to Host the Ultimate Game Night";
   - Hosting live Q&A sessions or virtual game nights where followers can interact with me/the team, discussing our favorite board games;
   - Creating polls or quizzes related to board games to encourage interaction and foster a sense of community among your followers.

3. **TikTok:**
   - Creating short and catchy videos showcasing the process of listing a board game for sale on your website, including features like photos, descriptions, and pricing.
   - Filming quick tutorials or tips on how to play popular board games, adding a link to the website where users can find those games for sale;
   - Jumping on trending challenges or hashtags on TikTok and incorporate them into your content in a creative way that relates to board games;
   - Collaborating with board game influencers or creators to reach a wider audience.

### Agile Development

The development process for this project followed Agile methodology, emphasizing continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

**Project Management**: I utilised GitHub Project boards to manage tasks, user stories, and project progression effectively.

DA MODIFICARE

**User Stories**: User stories were categorized in a Kanban Board into EPICs A, B, C, D, E, and F based on user types and content specificity. I prioritized user stories using the MoSCoW method, which categorizes requirements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have categories based on their importance and urgency.

## Database creation
The database used is PostgreSQL.

### How to get started:
1. Go to https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/
2. Input email address and click Submit;
3. The Database will be created and the details emailed;
4. You will need the DATABASE_URL to connect the database to your project.

### How to connect the database to the project:
1. Create a file named **env.py** at the top level of the project;
2. Open the **.gitignore** file and add **env.py** to prevent the secret data you will add to it from being pushed to GitHub.
3. In the **env.py** file, import Python's operating system module and use it to set the value of the **DATABASE_URL** constant to the URL copied from the details emailed to you - see below:
```
import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL", "<your-database-URL>")
```
4. Pip install the two packages required to connect to your PostgreSQL database. Then add them to the requirements file:
```
pip3 install dj-database-url~=0.5 psycopg2~=2.9
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
5. In **settings.py** import the appropriate packages and connect the **settings.py** file to the **env.py** file:
```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
